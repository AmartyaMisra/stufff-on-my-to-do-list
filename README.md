# 📝 Stuff on My To-Do List  

Welcome to my little **lab of unfinished experiments, half-baked ideas, and projects waiting to hatch**.  
This repo is where I park things I want to build, learn, or just mess around with when the mood strikes.  

It’s not meant to be polished. It’s a **sandbox of curiosities**. Expect:  
- Random mini projects (from scripts to side-apps)  
- Notes, prompts, and sketches of bigger ideas  
- Things I might return to… or abandon forever  
- A timeline of my tinkering brain 🧠  

## Why does this exist?  
Because the best ideas usually start as scraps in a notebook,  
and this repo is my public notebook. Think of it as a **to-do list in source control**.  

## Current Direction  
- Small standalone experiments  
- Useful-but-fun tools (sleep loggers, CLI toys, etc.)  
- Occasional deeper dives into cybersecurity, data, or just tech mischief  

## How to Read This Repo  
- Browse folders like you’re poking around a messy garage.  
- Don’t expect everything to run. Some things are sketches, some are prototypes.  
- If you find something interesting, fork it, remix it, or just enjoy the chaos.
